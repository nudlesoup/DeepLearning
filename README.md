# DeepLearning

I have worked on the following Projects :
- 3DdetectionPrototype
The Goal of this project: Detect and track 4 different objects includes vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist and traffic lights (labeled as 1, 2, 3, 20).   
And I have done some things below:  

 1.Base on Deep learning (Mxnet) to implement object detection and tracking system on self-driving car system      

 2.Based on given dataset and Yolo algorithm to construct special neural network model and update a new loss function      

 3.Utilize GPU for training and tune parameters to converge and optimize the result        

 4.Optimize feedforward inference network and realize object detection and tracking in real time on camera
